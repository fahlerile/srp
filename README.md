# srp

(stands for **s**oftware **r**endering **p**ipeline)

Highly inspired by OpenGL API and made only for learning purposes, this is my first serious project in C (still WIP at the moment) and my first project in the field of computer graphics. The only dependency is [`stb_image`](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h). You probably *do not* want to use this in production code!

This is a rendering pipeline written fully in software that uses only the CPU for computation. It features:
- Fully programmable vertex and fragment shaders
- A small math library with vector and matrix structures to use in shader programming
- Texture mapping
- Shader uniforms
- Affine attribute interpolation

Read the documentation for `master` branch [here](https://fahlerile.github.io/srp/), or build the documentation yourself (see Building section)

## Building

```bash
git clone https://www.github.com/fahlerile/srp
mkdir srp/build
cd srp/build
cmake .. -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
cd bin
```

You can also build the examples with `-D BUILD_EXAMPLES=1` and the documentation with `-D BUILD_DOCS=1` arguments passed to `cmake`. Building the documentation requires having [`dot`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz) binary in `PATH`.

And a lot more... Here I mentioned only those projects on which I looked at as a reference while making this one. If you need more similar projects, see [this](https://github.com/topics/software-rendering) and [this](https://github.com/topics/software-rasterizer).

## TODO
### Features
- [ ] Add interpolation with perspective correction
- [ ] Fix rasterization rules (see the gaps between triangles in `03_spinning_textured_cube` example)
- [ ] Implement other primitives (lines, points, lines/triangles strip/adjacency etc.)
- [ ] Implement interpolation for types other than `double` (shouldn't it just be `double` and `float`?)
- [ ] Add multisampling
- [ ] Advanced texture techniques:
    - [ ] (Bi)linear filtering
    - [ ] Mipmapping
    - [ ] Anisotropic filtering
    - [ ] Transparent textures?

### Optimization
- [ ] Are `vec` and `mat` functions inlined by the compiler? Should they be? Are `mat` or `vec` ever passed by-value?
- [ ] Use a profiler to find bottlenecks in frequently-used functions
- [ ] Draw primitives in parallel (OpenMP)

### Portability/API design
- [x] Separate constructors into two functions for buffer objects (create and copy data)
- [x] Getters and setters for `SRPTexture`
- [ ] Rename enum members to avoid namespace pollution

## What I learned
This is a section specially for my portfolio, so feel free to skip it. Well, I learned:
- Some C programming techniques and library design
- Importance of having a plan, an end goal:
    - This project started as something completely different from what it is now
- Basic Git workflow
- The importance of atomic (if it is possible) commits and meaningful commit names
- Premature optimization and optimization without measuring *really* is the root of all evil
- Importance of readable code and comments where they are needed
